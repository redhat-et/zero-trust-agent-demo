# Envoy ext-proc scaffolding

This directory contains the original scaffolding files with TODO markers.

Use these files if you want to start fresh or compare your solutions.

## Files

- `main.go` - gRPC server entry point (Task 4)
- `processor.go` - ExternalProcessor implementation (Tasks 2, 3)
- `envoy.yaml` - Envoy configuration (Task 5)

## How to use

To start fresh, copy these files to the parent directory:

```bash
cp scaffolding/*.go .
cp scaffolding/envoy.yaml .
```

Then work through the tasks in the main README.md.
