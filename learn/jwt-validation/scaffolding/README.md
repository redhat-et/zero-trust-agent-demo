# JWT validation scaffolding

This directory contains the original scaffolding files with TODO markers.

Use these files if you want to start fresh or compare your solutions.

## Files

- `main.go` - CLI entry point (Task 8)
- `jwt.go` - JWT parsing utilities (Tasks 2, 4, 6)
- `jwks.go` - JWKS fetching (Task 5)
- `claims.go` - Claim structures and delegation (Tasks 3, 7)

## How to use

To start fresh, copy these files to the parent directory:

```bash
cp scaffolding/*.go .
```

Then work through the tasks in the main README.md.
