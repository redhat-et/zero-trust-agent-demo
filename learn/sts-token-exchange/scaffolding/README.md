# STS token exchange scaffolding

This directory contains the original scaffolding files with TODO markers.

Use these files if you want to start fresh or compare your solutions.

## Files

- `main.go` - CLI entry point (Task 6)
- `exchange.go` - Token exchange logic (Tasks 3, 4, 5)
- `config.go` - Configuration handling (Task 2)

## How to use

To start fresh, copy these files to the parent directory:

```bash
cp scaffolding/*.go .
```

Then work through the tasks in the main README.md.
